- **Transaction History**: View all account movements with dates
- **Transfer Money**: Send money to other bankist users
- **Request Loan**: Request a loan if you meet the requirements
- **Close Account**: Delete your account
- **Auto Logout**: Timer-based session management for security

- **Formatted Numbers**: Locale-specific currency and date formatting

## Responsive Design 📲

The application is responsive and works on:

- Desktop
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

## Technologies Used 👩🏽‍💻

- HTML5
- CSS3 with CSS Variables for theming
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Internationalization API for formatting dates and currencies

## Array Methods Demonstrated 📝

The project showcases various JavaScript array methods including:

- `map()`: For creating usernames and transforming data
- `filter()`: For calculating deposits and withdrawals
- `reduce()`: For summing up balances and statistics
- `find()`: For locating specific accounts
